rsspew keeps track of URLs in RSS feeds and opens new ones, possibly spewing browser tabs all over the place.

Every time you run it, it fetches the content of the RSS feeds listed in ~/.rsspew/feeds, looks for item URLs, and compares them to a list of known URLs. New URLs are opened and added to the list.

The program used to open URLs can be set at the top of the script. By default, xdg-open is used, which uses the default web browser on many systems.

rsspew is written in POSIX sh, and has been tested with dash and bash.

The script doesn't really understand XML, and searches for things that look like item links. It might open things that aren't real links, and it might miss real links.
